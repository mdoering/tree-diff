# tree-diff
Experiments showing (taxonomic) tree diffs.


## Tree files
We experiment with different kind of tree files.

The GBIF Checklist Bank and backbone tools can dump datasets in simple hierarchical text files or create an xml representation. The text files can either use the simple canonical name without authorship or full names ("-full") with authorships.
